# Programming assignment Affadit

# Single programmer:
# I promise that the attached assignment is my own work. I recognize that should this not
# be the case, I will be subject to penalties as outlined in the course syllabus. Jacob Holloway


# â€¢ Multiple programmer:
# We the undersigned promise that we have in good faith attempted to follow the principles
# of pair programming. Although we were free to discuss ideas with others, the
# implementation is our own. We have shared a common workspace (possibly virtually) and
# taken turns at the keyboard for the majority of the work that we are submitting.
# Furthermore, any non programming portions of the assignment were done independently.
# We recognize that should this not be the case, we will be subject to penalties as outlined
# in the course syllabus. [Your Names]
